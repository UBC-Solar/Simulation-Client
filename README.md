# Simulation-Client

This is the front-end side of the simulation application. The goal of this application is to create a local user-interface to host the simulation. This app will be able to pull telemetry data from a database and allows the user to manually prompt the simulation to re-run based of updated data. It is built using a combination of Electron and React. This application uses hidden windows to launch python sub-processes.
